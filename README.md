#  Brain Tumour Machine Learning Model Analysis - FYP Project

This project aims to find out the best machine learning model to use for Image Classification. Note: It is a very general analysis, with no focus of optimisation.  It covers my basic understanding of the said models and how they work, along with practicing proper project methodology when it comes to ML Projects
